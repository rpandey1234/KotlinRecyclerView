# KotlinRecyclerView
This project demonstrates an implementation of the RecyclerView in Android in &lt; 50 lines of Kotlin code. The RecyclerView component on Android enforces the ViewHolder pattern that comes from best practices using ListView. This ensures we're adhering to best practices around power and memory consumption.
